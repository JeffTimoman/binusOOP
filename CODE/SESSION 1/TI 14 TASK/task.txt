Below program should be made using Repetition Concept (While, Do While, For)

1. Ask the user to input a number (n). The program then will print all natural numbers from 1 to n.

Input : 5

Output : 1 2 3 4 5

2. Ask the user to input a number (n). The program then will print all natural numbers in reverse from 1 to n.

Input : 5

Output : 5 4 3 2 1

3. Program to print all alphabet (A-Z)

4. Ask the user to input two numbers (x and y, y must be greater than x). The program then will print the sum of numbers between x and y.

Input : 2 7

Output : 27

5. Ask the user to input two numbers (x and y). The program then will calculate x to the power of y. NB: Using the pow method for this problem is forbidden.

Input : 2 5

Output : 32

6. Ask the user to input two numbers (x and y). The program then will calculate HCF (Highest Common Factor) of x and y.

Input : 30 12

Output : 6

7. Ask the user to input a number (n). The Program then will print Fibonacci series up to n terms.

Input : 8

Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

8. Ask the user to input two numbers (x and y). The program then will calculate LCF (Lowest Common Multiple) of x and y.

Input : 30 12

Output : 6
